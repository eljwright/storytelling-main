            description: 'The history of segregation in Seattle, Washington is one with deep roots and multiple different stories. The city was founded on exclusionary bases, with legislation that expelled the native Duwamish people from residing within city limits. These segregationist roots persisted throughout the decades, with many explicit anti-Asian and anti-Black policies being enacted in the 19th and 20th centuries. This interactive mapping website will evaluate the way one specific practice known as redlining significantly contributed to socio-spatial inequality within Seattle, Washington. We will also consider the ways in which it still impacts communities to this day.',

In the aftermath of the Great Depression, president Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) started implementing what he called New Deal programs. These programs aimed to create social safety nets and promote economic recovery after the depression. As part of the New Deal, FDR established the Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to try and make homeownership more accessible for Americans. Once created the FHA helped standardize the 30 year mortgage and cemented homeownership as a central part of the “American Dream”.',

The residents are of the professional class, having an annual income of $4000 to $10,000 per year. There is very choice view property in this area. The homes, generally, are less than two years old-- in the $6500 to $15,000 price class; and well maintained. During 1935 there were some new residential structures placed under construction in this area. The property is protected by building and racial restrictions.”<br><br>The racial restrictions the area description refers to what are known as restrictive covenants, another discriminatory housing practice that was common practice in Seattle. These restrictive covenants were conditions on the sale of a property that included clauses prohibiting the sale, rent or lease of the property to specified racial/religious groups. Alongside redlining, racial covenants played a major role in the segregation of Seattle and have major impacts today.

In addition to showing where certain racial groups lived, the HOLC racial map also included arrows that showed the “direction of infiltration” of those groups. This is likely a direct reference to the FHA’s Underwriting Manual which warned housing developers, without sufficient evidence, that property values would be threatened by the “infiltration of inharmonious racial groups”. This map was submitted on the same day and by the same HOLC field agent as the mortgage security redlining map, and is a clear demonstration that the HOLC was always considering racial factors in their maps.<br><br><img class="small_image" src="/images/Racial_Map_Legend.jpg" alt="legend of the HOLC racial map of Seattle">',

Before the sit-in there was a protest outside the building of approximately 300 individuals in support of open housing policy. At this protest they passed around a handbill that stated: <blockquote cite=""https://historylink.org/File/3161"">As citizens of Seattle and members of the Central District Youth Club, we feel humiliated by the slow process of the City of Seattle to adopt open housing. We are past the stage of patience, we also are past the stage of committees and subcommittees. We want open housing today.</blockquote>The second protest of the civil rights movement in Seattle was later that same month, on <b>July 20th, 1963.</b> This in the city council chdemonstration was in protest of the composition of Mayor Clinton’s proposed 12-member human rights commission, which only included two African American nominees.

            title: 'Legislation and Modern Impacts',
            description: 'Although redlining was finally outlawed at the federal level and local levels in 1968 with the Fair Housing Act and Fair Housing Ordinance (Ordinance 96619) respectively, elements of the practice persisted for several years. In 1975 the Central Seattle Community Council Federation published a report titled Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle that outlined how even after this legislation, residents of the Central District, a redlined zone, still faced major barriers to receiving home loans. After this report was published, several local government initiatives were undertaken as an attempt to reverse the effects of redlining, these include Seattle’s Reinvestment Task Force (established 1975) and the Lenders Review Board (est 1976). <br>Despite efforts from the city government, redlining still has a mjaor impact on Seattle today. Its legacy can be seen across many areas of inequality, including income, health, education and employment, among many others. In the following sections, we’ll look more closely at how these impacts show up in different parts of the city.<br><br><img class="small_image" src="/images/Lenders_Review_Board.jpg" alt="ad promoting the lenders review board">',

            title: 'Modern Wealth Inequality',
            description: 'One of the most prominent effects of redlining is that it prevented people in redlined neighborhoods from being able to own homes and build generational wealth. This led to enormous wealth gaps that still persist today between those who lived in C and D graded neighborhoods and those who lived in A and B graded neighborhoods. A recent study by ECONorthwest found that without racially discriminatory housing practices (including redlining but also practices such as racial housing covenants and private discrimination) King County’s BIPOC households would hold between $12 and $34 billion in additional wealth today. Additionally they found that each individual Black household in King County would hold between $105,000 to $306,000 in additional wealth today if it weren’t for this racial discrimination in housing.  <br><br> These wealth disparities impact more than just finances, they also have a significant influence on things such as access to education or healthcare.',

            title: 'Disinvestment & Neighborhood Deterioration',
            description: 'On top of the severe wealth disparity faced by residents of redlined neighborhoods, redlining also caused disinvestment which has continued to impact communities for decades. The 1975 report Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle defines displacement as “a general policy followed by banks of taking in savings deposits from residents of a redlined area but refusing to return that money, in the form of home, business, and consumer loans, to the community that provided the money”.<br><br>This practice goes against how banks are intended to function. Normally, money individuals deposit into banks will later be reinvested back into the same community it came from, by supporting home ownership, local businesses, and public infrastructure like schools. But in redlined areas, banks refused to give loans to the people living there. Instead, the money local residents deposited into banks would be sent to support the development of wealthy suburbs outside the city.<br><br>This turned redlining into a self-fulfilling prophecy. By denying access to loans and reinvestment, banks caused redlined neighborhoods to deteriorate, justifying their original “hazardous” designations and blaming residents for the conditions the banks themselves caused. This lack of investment is more than just an economic issue. It has contributed to crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and limited job opportunities. These consequences continue to affect formerly redlined communities today and play a major role in the continued inequality within Seattle.<br><br><img src="/images/Redlining_and_Disinvestment.jpg" alt="image of the cover of the Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle Report">',

            title: 'Gentrification & Displacement',
            description: 'Redlining and the disinvestment it caused left certain communities, particularly those that were redlined, more vulnerable to gentrification. <b>Gentrification is the process in which lower-income urban neighborhoods undergo demographic shifts due to increased investment in the area and wealthier individuals moving in.</b> Gentrification often leads to displacement of long-term residents, as increased investment drives up rent prices, making it unaffordable for them to stay. Gentrification disproportionately affects formerly redlined neighborhoods due to their history of disinvestment, often forcing people out of the only neighborhoods they were historically allowed to live in.<br> <br> While this issue affects many American cities, the tech economy of Seattle makes these trends even more apparent. In 2019, Seattle was named the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-ranks-near-top-for-gentrification-but-that-might-not-be-as-bad-as-you-think-study-finds/3rd" target="_blank"> third most gentrifying US city.</a> Gentrification and displacement illustrate that housing inequality is not only the result of poor government policy but that corporations also bear a significant portion of the responsibility. In Seattle, these corporations play a key role in the gentrification of formerly redlined zones, as they bring an influx of out-of-towners who often desire to live in the city center. In addition to the population growth they cause, Seattle corporations have been described as <a href="https://systemicjustice.org/article/redlining-and-disinvestment-a-case-study-on-racial-segregation-and-gentrification-throughout-seattles-central-district/" target="_blank">“[capturing] the city’s political and economic landscape”</a>, leveraging their power to block affordable housing initiatives.',

The Rainier Valley was graded as “Definitely Declined” on the 1936 HOLC map, with area descriptions (C13 & C14) labeling it a “very spotted residential district composed of people of various nationalities”. Similarly to the Central District, redlining caused a severe lack of investment in Rainier Valley which has continued to affect its neighborhoods for decades.<br><br>The Rainier Valley also faces another issue which stems from the city expanding its light rail service to the area in the name of “Transit Oriented Development”. This has played into the gentrification of the valley, as the new stations have brought increased development that has significantly changed the character of the neighborhood. In particular, areas around the light rail stations have seen dramatic increases in rent and land values.',

            description: 'The long-term effects of redlining are especially visible in Rainier Beach, one of Seattle’s most racially diverse neighborhoods, where 82% of residents identify as people of color. Like other redlined neighborhoods of Seattle, Rainier Beach has experienced decades of disinvestment. Today, residents have started calling it “gentrification ground zero” due to rising housing prices and the displacement of longtime residents.<br><br><b><a href="https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2018/12/05/displacement-tax-update-gentrification-ground-zero-rainier-beach" target="_blank">One resident discusses:</a></b><blockquote cite=""https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2018/12/05/displacement-tax-update-gentrification-ground-zero-rainier-beach"">“And here we are, living history as it repeats itself in the Rainier Valley. As White people move in, property values increase and, by extension, my taxes increase. The city of Seattle was clearly complicit in allowing property taxes to become a tool of racial oppression.”</blockquote><br>This quote highlights how gentrification in Rainier Beach is history repeating itself, building on the patterns of inequality that redlining created. It also shows how gentrification doesn’t just affect renters, as it can cause property taxes that homeowners pay to increase.<br><br>Finally, even for renters that can afford to stay in the area as it gentrifies, rising housing prices often make it impossible for them to ever buy their own home. In Rainier Beach, average home values have increased by almost $170,000 in the past five years. This perpetuates the same trends that redlining caused in the first place, keeping homeownership firmly out of reach for many Seattlites.<br><br><img src="/images/LawnSign_2.jpg">',

            description: 'The maps, stories, and data we’ve explored tell a clear story:<br><b>Redlining isn’t just a case of historic discrimination but its legacy continues to shape inequality in Seattle today.</b><br><br>Understanding the connections between historic discriminatory practices and modern day inequality gives us a better understanding of how deeply systemic and persistent these issues are. It also gives us the power to challenge them and push for better solutions going forward.<br><br>Now you have the opportunity to continue exploring the legacy of redlining on your own terms. <b>Use the comprehensive map below </b>to compare the original HOLC zones (left) to the RSE Composite Index (right), to explore connections of redlining to modern day inequality. Use the map to look at your own neighborhood or explore areas you care about, and consider what this history means for the future of our city.',
